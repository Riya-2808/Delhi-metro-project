Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to find effective cost and time by choosing the shortest path 
Used the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph which in this project represents a network of metro stations 
Calculated the path efficiently by considering direct connections and intermediate stations and successfully provided the optimal route, minimizing the number of metro stops for a seamless travel experience
